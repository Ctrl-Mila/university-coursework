# Big-O Fundamentals

This section focuses on the core concepts of **Big-O notation** and asymptotic reasoning.

The exercises included here analyze whether certain functions can be bounded by others, using formal Big-O definitions and growth comparison.

Topics covered:
- Comparison between exponential functions
- Dominant terms in mixed expressions
- Effect of constants and lower-order terms
- Polynomial bounds
