## Problem

Determine whether the following statements are true:

1. O(2n) = O(n)  
2. O(n + 1000) = O(n)

## Approach

Big-O notation ignores constant factors and constant additive terms, focusing only on growth rates.

## Time Complexity Analysis

- O(2n) simplifies to O(n)
- O(n + 1000) simplifies to O(n)

**Result:** Both statements are true.

## Conclusion

Constants do not affect asymptotic complexity. This allows Big-O notation to describe algorithmic scalability independently of hardware or implementation details.
