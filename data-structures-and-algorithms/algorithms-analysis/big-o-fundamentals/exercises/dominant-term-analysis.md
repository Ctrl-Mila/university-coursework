## Problem

Determine the Big-O time complexity of the following function:

f(n) = 5n² + 3n + 20

## Approach

Big-O notation focuses on the dominant term of the function for large values of `n`. Constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored.

## Time Complexity Analysis

- Dominant term: 5n²
- Lower-order terms: 3n and 20
- Constants are discarded

**Result:** `O(n²)`

## Conclusion

When analyzing asymptotic behavior, only the term with the highest growth rate matters. This simplifies complexity analysis while preserving accuracy for large inputs.
