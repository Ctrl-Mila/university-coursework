## Problem

Determine which function grows faster as n increases:

- n
- log(n)

## Approach

Growth rates can be compared by observing how each function behaves as `n` approaches infinity.

## Time Complexity Analysis

- log(n) grows very slowly
- n grows linearly and eventually dominates log(n)

**Result:** `n grows faster than log(n)`

## Conclusion

Logarithmic functions are significantly more efficient than linear ones for large inputs, which is why they are highly desirable in algorithm design.
