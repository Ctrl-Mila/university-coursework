# Recursion and Algorithm Optimization

This section focuses on recursive algorithms, recurrence relations, and performance optimization.

The exercises compare different recursive implementations, analyze their time complexity, and demonstrate how inefficient solutions can be replaced with significantly better ones by rethinking the approach.

Topics covered:
- Linear vs exponential recursion
- Recurrence relation analysis
- Divide-and-conquer strategies
- Algorithmic optimization
