## Problem

Determine the time complexity of the following loop:

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // O(1)
}

## Approach

The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `n`.

## Time Complexity Analysis

- Number of iterations: `n`
- Work per iteration: `O(1)`

**Result:** `O(n)`

## Conclusion

A loop that iterates once per element of the input has linear time complexity.
