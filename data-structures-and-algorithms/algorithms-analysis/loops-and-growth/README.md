# Loop Analysis and Growth Rates

This section analyzes the time complexity of iterative algorithms with different loop behaviors. The exercises illustrate how loop structure, step size, and nesting affect overall time complexity.

Topics covered:
- Logarithmic loops
- Nested loops with variable increments
- Harmonic series in complexity analysis
- Relation between theoretical complexity and empirical measurements
