# Algorithm Analysis and Time Complexity

This folder contains a curated set of academic exercises focused on **algorithm analysis**, **time complexity**, and **Big-O notation**.

The goal of this section is to demonstrate:
- Understanding of asymptotic analysis
- The ability to reason about algorithm efficiency
- Correct use of Big-O notation
- Comparison between different algorithmic approaches
- Identification and implementation of more efficient solutions

## Contents

- **Big-O Fundamentals**  
  Basic asymptotic reasoning, bounds, and growth comparison.

- **Loops and Growth Analysis**  
  Time complexity analysis of iterative algorithms with non-trivial loop behavior.

- **Recursion and Optimization**  
  Recursive algorithms, recurrence relations, and performance improvements.

Each subfolder contains a short explanation of the topic and a selected set of representative exercises.
