# Binary Trees

This folder contains selected exercises related to **Binary Trees**, developed as part of the course *Algorithms and Data Structures*.

The goal of these exercises is to demonstrate:
- Recursive processing of binary trees
- Tree traversals and structural comparison
- Path-based computations
- Creation of derived trees from an original structure

Each exercise is organized in its own folder and includes:
- A brief description of the problem
- A Java implementation
- Test code to validate the solution
