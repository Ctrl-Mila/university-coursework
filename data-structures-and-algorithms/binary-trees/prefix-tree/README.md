# Prefix Tree Validation

This exercise checks whether one binary tree is a prefix of another binary tree.

A binary tree A is considered a prefix of binary tree B if:
- Both trees match in structure for the nodes present in A
- All corresponding nodes contain the same values

The algorithm performs a recursive comparison of both trees, validating
data equality and structural compatibility.
