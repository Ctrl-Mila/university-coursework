# Basic Graph Traversals

This exercise contains basic graph traversal algorithms used as a foundation for more complex graph problems.

The goal is to demonstrate how to navigate a graph structure using standard traversal strategies.

## Implemented Traversals

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

## Concepts Applied

- Graph representation
- Vertex visitation tracking
- Recursive and iterative traversal strategies
- Use of auxiliary data structures (lists / queue)
