# Graph Algorithms

This section contains graph-related exercises developed as part of my Algorithms and Data Structures coursework.

The goal of these implementations is to demonstrate:
- Modeling real-world problems using graphs
- Graph traversals (DFS / BFS)
- Path-finding under different constraints
- Recursive search with backtracking
- Optimization criteria applied to graph paths

All exercises are implemented in Java using a generic graph structure (`Graph`, `Vertex`, `Edge`).
