# General Trees – Java Exercises

This repository contains a curated set of exercises implemented in **Java** using the **General Tree** data structure.

The selected problems aim to demonstrate:
- recursive tree traversals,
- level-based logic,
- result accumulation,
- structural property validation,
- and backtracking techniques.

Each exercise is located in its own folder and includes a brief explanation of the problem and the solution approach.
