# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains selected Java implementations developed during the course *Algorithms and Data Structures*.

The focus of this project is on **practical problem solving** and the implementation of core data structures and algorithms, rather than purely theoretical content. The exercises included here demonstrate the use of:

- Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java
- Linear data structures (lists, stacks, queues)
- Tree-based structures (binary trees and general trees)
- Algorithm analysis and time complexity
- Graph representations and traversals

Each folder groups related concepts and includes a brief README explaining the topic and the purpose of the exercises. Only representative and complete exercises were selected in order to keep the repository clear, readable, and relevant.

This repository was built as part of an academic course, but structured to reflect clean code practices and problem-solving skills applicable to real-world software development.
