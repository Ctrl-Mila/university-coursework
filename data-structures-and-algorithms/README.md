# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains selected Java implementations developed during the course *Algorithms and Data Structures*.

The focus of this project is on **practical problem solving** and the implementation of core data structures and algorithms. 
The exercises included here demonstrate the use of:

- Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java
- Linear data structures (lists, stacks, queues)
- Tree-based structures (binary trees and general trees)
- Algorithm analysis and time complexity
- Graph representations and traversals

Each folder groups related concepts and includes a brief README explaining the topic and the purpose of the exercises.
