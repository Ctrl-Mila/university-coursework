# University Coursework

This repository contains academic coursework from the **Analista Programador Universitario** program at the  
**Universidad Nacional de La Plata – Facultad de Informática**.

The materials included here are part of my academic training and cover core computer science topics such as:

- Algorithms and programming logic  
- Data structures  
- Database design and relational modeling  
- Software engineering fundamentals  
- Programming exercises and theoretical notes  

Most of the content is in Spanish, as it was developed as part of my university studies.
