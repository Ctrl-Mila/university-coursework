# Master–Detail Processing and Control Breaks (Pascal)

This section contains advanced file processing exercises implemented in Pascal, focused on classical data organization techniques used in batch systems and file-based data processing.

The exercises included here cover scenarios such as:
- Updating master files using one or multiple detail files
- Aggregation of data grouped by one or more keys (control breaks)
- Single-pass processing of sorted files
- Generation of summarized reports with totals and subtotals

All solutions assume sequential access to ordered files and emphasize efficiency, correctness, and clear algorithmic structure.
