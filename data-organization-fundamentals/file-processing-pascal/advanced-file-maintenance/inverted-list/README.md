# Novelas File with Inverted List

Manage a file of “novelas” (TV series) filmed during the current year using an **inverted list**:

- Create and load the file from keyboard input.
- Maintain the file: **add, modify, delete** novels.
- Logical deletion reuses space efficiently through inverted list.
- List all records (including deleted ones) into a text file.
