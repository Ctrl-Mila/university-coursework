# Cellphone Store File Processing

This exercise implements a file management system for a cellphone store using Pascal.

The program works with:
- A binary file of cellphone records
- A structured text file used for data import and export

Each cellphone record includes:
- Code
- Name
- Description
- Brand
- Price
- Minimum stock
- Available stock

## Implemented Features

- Creation of a binary file from a structured text file
- Listing cellphones with stock below minimum
- Filtering records based on a substring in the description
- Exporting the binary file back to a text file

## Concepts Covered

- Text file processing
- Binary file creation and traversal
- Data import/export
- Sequential access
- Record filtering
- String handling (`Pos`)

This exercise demonstrates real-world file processing workflows, including persistence and data exchange.
