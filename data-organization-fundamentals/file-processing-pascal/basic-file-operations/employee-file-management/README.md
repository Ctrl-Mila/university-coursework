This exercise implements a menu-driven Pascal program that manages an unordered binary file of employees.

Each employee record contains:
- Employee number
- First name
- Last name
- Age
- DNI

## Implemented Features

- Creation of a binary file with employee records entered from keyboard
- Sequential traversal of the file
- Search by name or last name
- Listing all employees
- Filtering employees older than 70 years

## Concepts Covered

- Binary files (`file of record`)
- Sequential access
- Record-based processing
- Menu-based program structure
- Simple filtering conditions

This exercise represents the foundational operations required to manipulate structured data stored in files.
