# Data Organization Fundamentals

This section covers the fundamental concepts behind data storage, file organization, and information access.

The exercises focus on how data is physically stored and processed before the use of modern database management systems.

Topics include:
- File-based data storage
- Logical and physical record organization
- Sequential and direct access methods
- Master-detail processing
- Logical deletion and file compaction
- Indexed files and tree-based structures
- Hashing techniques for efficient data access

All practical implementations are written in Pascal, reflecting an academic approach focused on understanding low-level data organization and algorithmic processing.
