# Extensible Hashing – Bucket Capacity 2

## Problem Statement

For the following keys, perform the dispersion process using the **Extensible Hashing** method.

Assume:

- Each bucket has a capacity of **2 records**.
- The natural number indicates the order of arrival of operations.
- The state of the file must be shown after each operation.
- Briefly justify the steps taken in case of collision or overflow.

The directory uses the least significant bits of the hash value.

## Operations

1. + Darín  
2. + Alterio  
3. + Sbaraglia  
4. + De la Serna  
5. + Altavista  
6. + Grandinetti  
7. - Altavista  
8. - Sbaraglia  

The corresponding hash values are provided in the exercise image.

## Requirements

For each operation:

- Show the state of the directory.
- Show the state of the data file (buckets).
- Justify any split, directory expansion, merge, or directory reduction.
