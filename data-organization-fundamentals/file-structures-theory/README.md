# File Structures Theory

This section contains theoretical exercises focused on advanced file organization techniques and indexing structures.

Unlike the previous folders (which include full Pascal implementations), this section emphasizes **structural reasoning, state evolution, and performance implications** of dynamic file structures.

The exercises are solved step by step, showing the intermediate states of each structure after insertions, deletions, splits, merges, and redistributions.

## Topics Covered

### Hashing Techniques
- Collision resolution
- Overflow handling
- Dynamic Hash table performance analysis
- Bucket splitting and directory expansion

### Tree-Based Index Structures
- Multiway search trees
- B Trees
- B+ Trees
- Node splitting
- Redistribution
- Height growth
- Search and deletion behavior
- Structural invariants
