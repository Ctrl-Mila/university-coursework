# B-Tree Order 5 – Left Underflow Policy

This exercise analyzes a B-Tree of order 5 under a sequence of insertions and deletions.

## Operations

- +320
- -390
- -400
- -533

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Leaf overflow and split
- Split propagation to internal nodes
- Root split and height increase
- Internal node deletion
- Successor replacement
- Underflow resolution using **left policy**
- Node merging
- Disk read/write accounting

Each operation includes:
- Search path analysis
- Structural modification
- I/O count (reads and writes)
- Graphical tree state
