# Concurrency – Practice 4

This folder contains selected exercises from Practice 4 of the Concurrency module.
The focus of this practice is on classic synchronization models implemented in the
CMRE (r-info) concurrent robot environment.

The selected exercises demonstrate well-known concurrency patterns:

- Client–Server model using message passing
- Producer–Consumer model with shared resources and synchronization

These examples were chosen to clearly show coordination, communication, and
synchronization between concurrent processes.
