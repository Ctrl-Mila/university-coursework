## Practice 2 – Message Passing and Coordination

This practice focuses on concurrency through **message passing** between multiple robots.
The exercises emphasize coordination, synchronization, and communication patterns
in a shared environment.

Key concepts covered in this practice include:

- Message-based communication between concurrent agents
- Coordination using a central controller (fiscalizer / leader robot)
- Controlled access to shared areas
- Non-deterministic behavior using randomness
- Aggregation of partial results from multiple workers

The selected exercise demonstrates a **controlled-access model**, where a fiscalizer
robot manages the access of multiple worker robots to a restricted area and determines
a final result based on their activity.
