# Concurrency

This folder contains selected exercises and practices related to **concurrent programming** developed during the Concurrency module.

The goal of this module is to progressively introduce and apply core concurrency concepts, starting from basic notions and advancing toward classical synchronization models used in real-world problems.

## Topics covered

- Fundamental concepts of concurrency
- Concurrent execution in the CMRE environment (r-info)
- Message passing and robot communication
- Resource locking and release (critical sections)
- Synchronization models:
  - Barriers
  - Producer / Consumer
  - Master / Slave
  - Other coordination patterns

## Structure

Each practice is stored in its own folder and includes:
- The source files corresponding to the exercises
- A brief README explaining the objective of the practice and the concepts involved
