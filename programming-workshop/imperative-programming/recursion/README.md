# Recursion – Programming Workshop

This section contains selected recursive programming exercises developed during
the course **Programming Workshop** (Analista Programador Universitario – UNLP).

The focus is on understanding recursive problem solving, base cases, and
correct function decomposition.

## 📘 Topics covered

- Recursive algorithms
- Base and recursive cases
- Traversal of data structures using recursion

## 🧠 Skills demonstrated

- Recursive reasoning
- Problem decomposition
- Algorithmic thinking

> Exercises are presented in Spanish as part of the original academic coursework.
