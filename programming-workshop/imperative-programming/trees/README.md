# Trees (Binary Search Trees)

This folder contains exercises focused on Binary Search Trees (BST),
developed as part of the Programming Workshop course.

The exercises include:
- construction and traversal of binary search trees
- data aggregation per node
- searches by key and key ranges
- combination of trees with auxiliary data structures (linked lists)
- recursive processing of hierarchical data

All examples are implemented using the imperative programming paradigm.
